# Weather Dashboard

This weather dashboard uses JavaScript to pull current weather, and a 5-day forecast. <br>
Cities that users previously searched will be available thanks to localStorage!

## Functionality

When a user searches for a cities weather, the city is saved to a search history that the user can choose to keep or clear. <br>
The website then pulls the current weather data (Temperature, Wind, Humidity and UV Index) for that city as well as a 5-day forecast. <br>
If the user clicks on an item in the search history, the weather data for that city will repopulate.
